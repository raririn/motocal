This is the individual developing repository of Motocal / 元カレ計算機. Check out [organization repo](https://github.com/MotocalDevelopers/motocal) for the original.

Here, we focus on providing multilang support for motocal, as well as further development after the original author's retirement. If you have any suggestion on either translation or enhancement, feel free to raise issues (It is encouraged to raise translation issues here rather than in the organization repo).

Check the following documents for further developing:
